EnderChestNerf
==============

##About
Makes enderchests less overpowered. When a player crafts an enderchest, the item is assigned the name "Player's Chest" (Player being replaced with their actual name). If this chest is placed by this player or any other player, opening it will reveal Player's items. Picking up the chest with a Silk Touch pickaxe will still yield "Player's Chest".

##Migration
Unnamed enderchests cannot be placed. Existing ender chests (through being broken with Silk Touch or opened) will be assigned to the first player to do so.
